## Module Eight Journal – Project Three Reflection (Inventory Tracker)

## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
My app is an Inventory Tracker. The goal was to help users keep track of their items in one place instead of using notes or trying to remember everything. The app was designed to meet the user need of staying organized, quickly viewing inventory details, and managing items easily.

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
To support users, I needed screens that allowed a user to log in and then view and manage their inventory. The main features included viewing a list of items and being able to add, update, and delete inventory entries. My UI designs kept users in mind by using clear labels and a simple layout so the user always knows what to do next. The designs were successful because they focused on the core tasks without adding extra clutter.

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I coded the app in small steps by building one feature at a time. I started by connecting the screens, then added the logic for each action, and tested as I went so I could catch issues early. To stay organized, I used consistent naming and kept my changes manageable so debugging was easier. These strategies will help me in future projects because they keep development clear and prevent small mistakes from turning into bigger problems.

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I tested my app by running it in the Android emulator and clicking through the full user flow to make sure each screen worked correctly. I tested adding items, viewing the inventory list, and making changes to confirm the app behaved the way a real user would expect. Testing is important because it catches issues before submitting, and it revealed places where I needed to adjust logic or fix small UI and flow problems.

## Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
One challenge was making sure the app worked smoothly from screen to screen while also keeping the database actions working correctly. I had to troubleshoot step-by-step, adjust code, and re-test until the app flow felt simple and consistent for the user. Being flexible and willing to try different fixes helped me solve the issues.

## In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I was most successful in creating a working inventory management experience where users can manage inventory information through a user-friendly UI. This showed my skills in connecting UI design to app logic and building a functional mobile app that supports real user needs.
